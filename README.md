<h1>the project is not yet ready</h1>

<p>The config file from back-end was not yet exported because of the connection data for Database.</p>

<p>The docker file will also be created latter so I can deploy all that on the AWS.</p>

<p>The stack would be go/gin + next.js/react + supabase/postgresql First of all need to make back-end work proper to game be actually playable, also the DB must be migrated from local to supabase.</p>

Wish me GL
